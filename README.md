# MINE

You know, I'm really sick of loosing every single version of minesweeper that I make. 

This will hopefully won't somehow delete itself so that I don't have to make a new one. Anyway, it's quite literally minesweeper, with both a quick start option and a custom option, a timer and mine counter, and even a space clearing function that can clear adjacent empty cells, just like in normal minesweeper. The only issue is that it's slow, but at this point, its good enough for me. 

Controls:
2nd to reveal a cell
alpha to mark a cell with a flag (represented by multiplication symbol)
